### 📌 2025 Roadmap

- [x] Started learning embedded software seriously — mainly working with STM32 and C  
- [ ] Planning to upload several hardware projects I’ve already completed, with proper documentation  
- [ ] Working on an analog overdrive guitar pedal — it’s a personal project I want to finish and share with schematics and a demo  
- [ ] I already feel confident enough to take on freelance or collaborative work in hardware design, and I’m looking to make that more visible  
- [ ] I’m not yet at that level on the embedded software side, but I’m actively working to get there  

> 📌 *Note: For now, only hardware-focused projects will be shared on GitHub. Firmware will be added later as I progress.*
